# BOB Claw Rules

## Core Context

- **Product model: payback**. The system takes native BTC from the operator's Bitcoin L1 wallet, routes it through BOB Gateway into destination-chain DeFi positions, and returns a configured share of the realized profit back to a native BTC wallet on a fixed schedule. All PnL, caps, and KPIs are **BTC-denominated first**; USD values are display-only.
- **Operator = user**. Single-account mode. Multi-depositor vaulting (ERC-4626 shares, per-user cost basis) is out of scope until explicitly unlocked by a committed diff to this document.
- Capital sizing is operator-controlled per strategy. There is no project-wide ring-fenced wallet — the operator decides which wallet a given strategy uses and what cap that wallet runs at, declared in the strategy's config.
- Primary product objective: a native-BTC payback agent. Gateway / Instant Swap quote verification is the **transport and settlement lane**, not the alpha source by itself.
- Active strategy lanes: destination-chain BTC yield and lending loops, wrapper-BTC arbitrage across Gateway-supported chains, stable entry/exit loops, ETH-family deployment, tokenized reserve / gold sleeves, and other deterministic yield sleeves whose unwind cost is measured.
- Intermediate operating inventory may include ETH, stablecoins, tokenized gold, tokenized reserve assets, and other approved bluechips when deterministic unwind rules, explicit risk caps, and a measured BTC return path exist. The product still settles PnL and payback in BTC first.
- Lane selection is evidence-driven. If the Gateway route/arb lane has no positive measured edge, it moves to infrastructure/reevaluation mode and the highest evidence-backed strategy lane becomes primary.
- Ethereum L1 trading is allowed when fee analysis shows positive expected value after gas and slippage.
- **All 11 BOB Gateway official destinations are in scope** (Ethereum, BOB L2, Base, BNB, Avalanche, Unichain, Berachain, Optimism, Soneium, Sei, Sonic). Arbitrum and Polygon are NOT Gateway destinations as of 2026-04 — treat them as post-Gateway manual bridge only. See `docs/research/bob-ecosystem.md`.

## Objective Review

- Do not say a route is profitable until measured quote, fee, latency, and execution data support it.
- Do not treat a transport route as the product goal. A route can be technically proven while still not being a profitable strategy.
- Treat all profit claims as hypotheses until replay/shadow/live receipt data confirms them.
- If data says no trade, no trade.
- **Operator override (2026-04-24):** Merkl portfolio monetization is now in live-capital validation mode. Do not add more paper-only phase gates before execution. If the Merkl allocator/exit/refill path has committed caps, supported executor binding, inventory, required receipt proof, clear kill-switch, and deterministic policy approval, run it live within cap. The capital at risk is the validation sample.
- **Operator override (2026-04-22):** `wrapped-btc-loop-base-moonwell` and the broader wrapped-BTC lending-loop lane are on hold until an explicit committed diff removes the hold. Treat the current economics as insufficient, do not present that lane as primary alpha, and do not spend additional live-promotion effort on it unless the task is unwind/safety/receipt cleanup or the operator explicitly reopens the lane.
- If route alpha is exhausted, stop route brute-force and switch the primary review lane to receipt-backed strategy evidence.
- Overfitting guards: no strategy goes live solely on a single-period or single-pair backtest. At minimum, Walk-Forward purged/embargoed CV + at least one regime change in the sample window. Detail in `docs/research/ops-costs.md`.

## Execution Safety

- This system is designed for unattended, multichain, fully-automated execution. There is no manual promotion step and no tiered phase gate. A strategy runs the moment its config declares `autoExecute: true` with valid caps committed to the repo; it halts the moment the kill-switch file exists, the drawdown limit trips, or its caps are breached.
- Private keys live only inside the signer daemon process, loaded from OS keystore files via env-referenced paths: `BURNER_EVM_KEY_PATH` for all EVM chains, `BURNER_BTC_KEY_PATH` for native BTC signing. (`BURNER_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` is a backwards-compat alias pointing to the EVM key.) Keys must never appear in: LLM context (Claude / Codex / Copilot chat transcripts), dashboards, Telegram handlers, the repo, tool call arguments, logs, or audit files. Code written by any LLM may reference the key only via the env/path indirection — never the value.
- No LLM in the trade execution decision path. LLMs propose strategies, write code, and edit configs via committed diffs; a deterministic policy engine validates every intent; the signer signs only after policy approval. "Vibe coding" does not cross this line — code may be written by an LLM, but the runtime decision to sign is always policy code, not an LLM. **This rule applies identically to the payback engine**: payback amount, timing, and offramp-trigger decisions are deterministic rule-engine output, never LLM output.
- Emergency stop is a file. The signer checks `$KILL_SWITCH_PATH` before every broadcast on every chain. `touch` it and everything halts; remove it to resume. The payback scheduler checks the same kill-switch and will not trigger offramps while it is set.
- No unlimited approvals. Approvals are either per-tx (Permit2 where supported) or time-boxed and auto-revoked when a strategy goes idle.
- Leverage strategies (lending loops, perps) declare `healthFactorMin`, `liquidationBufferPct`, and an emergency-unwind path in their config. A breach triggers automatic unwind, not a wait.
- Auto-escalation of position size based on recent wins (martingale) is banned. Sizing comes from the strategy's declared caps, not from a streak counter.
- **Payback never escalates sizing**. Accumulated BTC on the operator's L1 wallet is out of the operating perimeter. It does not loop back into the strategy float unless an explicit committed diff deposits it.

## Risk Limits

- Caps are code, not env vars. Per-strategy per-tx USD, per-day USD, per-chain USD, and `maxDailyLossUsd` live in config files under `src/config/` (or the strategy's own config module). Raising a cap requires a committed diff — an LLM, dashboard, or Telegram handler cannot raise a cap at runtime.
- A strategy without a declared per-tx cap, per-day cap, and `maxDailyLossUsd` must not run. The signer rejects intents from capless strategies.
- Minimum net profit: positive after measured gas + slippage. Reject when estimated edge is at or below the measured gas+slippage variance floor.
- For leverage strategies: configured `healthFactorMin` and `liquidationBufferPct` must hold pre- and post-trade; either breach blocks the trade and triggers unwind.
- Max consecutive failures per strategy: 3 → auto-pause that strategy until the operator resumes it via a committed config flip.
- Failed-gas budget guard (`maxFailedGasCost24hUsd`) is enforced by the daemon — a route burning gas without fills auto-pauses.
- Drawdown kill-switch: if a strategy's realized 24h PnL drops below its `maxDailyLossUsd`, the daemon halts that strategy for the remainder of the day.
- Stale quotes rejected.
- **Payback-specific caps (declared in `src/config/payback.mjs`):**
  - `baseRatio` — default payback fraction of realized harvest profit, BTC units. Default 0.20. Config-only change.
  - `minPaybackBtc` — below this, accrue instead of offramp. Default 0.0005 BTC.
  - `maxOfframpCostPctOfPayback` — if round-trip cost exceeds this fraction of the payback amount, defer to next period. Default 0.10.
  - `perPeriodMaxBtc` — hard upper bound on a single payback disbursement.
  - `annualMaxPaybackBtc` — rolling 12-month cap; prevents a runaway rule from draining operating capital.
  - `regimeMultipliers` — {bear: ≤1.5, neutral: 1.0, bull_peak: ≥0.5} — applied deterministically from a whitelisted oracle (Mayer Multiple from a pinned data source), never from an LLM judgment.
  - `emergencyPause` triggers: protocol exploit on any touched protocol, measured Gateway offramp slippage >2%, operating-capital drawdown >30%. On trigger, payback scheduler halts until committed diff resumes it.
- On-chain note: `src/contracts/BalancerFlashArb.sol` ships with `minProfitUsdc = 300000` (USD 0.30, 6 decimals) in the constructor. Off-chain policy may permit any positive-EV trade, but the deployed contract still rejects flash-arb profits below USD 0.30 until it is redeployed or made owner-settable. Non-flash strategies are unaffected.

## Unattended Execution Architecture

Every executor, capital mover, strategy module, and the payback engine fit this architecture. Same architecture for dev burner and real capital — only the key-custody backend and the cap numbers change.

**Components**

1. **Proposer** — strategy modules under `src/strategy/` plus any LLM while coding. Emits trade intents as typed JSON. No keys.
2. **Policy Engine** — `src/executor/policy/` — pure functions. Validates intents against caps, HF floors, slippage, kill-switch, drawdown, stale-quote, approval hygiene, consecutive-failure counter, **and payback-specific caps**. Fully unit-testable. No keys.
3. **Signer Daemon** — `src/executor/signer/` — a long-running separate process. Holds keys for all chains. Signs only intents approved by Policy. Exposes a local socket. Two backends in tandem:
   - `EvmLocalKeySigner` — reads `BURNER_EVM_KEY_PATH`, signs for every EVM chain in `src/config/chains.mjs`, per-chain nonce manager (ethers v6).
   - `BtcLocalKeySigner` — reads `BURNER_BTC_KEY_PATH` (WIF or hex), UTXO selection, fee estimation, PSBT construction, RBF support. Used for Gateway onramp and native BTC sends.
   Both share the same `Signer` interface so they can be swapped later for `HardwareSigner` / `MpcSigner` with a one-line change.
4. **Capital Manager** — `src/executor/capital/` — maintains per-chain target balances declared in config. Auto-rebalances by enqueuing swap/bridge intents through the Signer. Replaces the human being told "swap this, hold that."
5. **Gas Float Keeper** — sub-policy of Capital Manager. Per-chain minimum native-token balance. Below threshold → auto-top-up from a configured source chain/asset.
6. **Receipt Ingestor** — every broadcast result (tx hash, revert reason, HF path, liquidation-buffer path, realized cost, realized carry) is appended to audit log and fed into the existing `ingest:*` pipelines automatically. No manual `npm run ingest:...`.
7. **Kill-switch + Watchdog** — file-based hard stop checked per-tx. Watchdog heartbeats the daemon; missed heartbeats → Telegram alert + auto-halt.
8. **Alerter** — Telegram. Reports cap utilization, pauses, kill events, daily PnL, **payback disbursements**. Read-only; no command-side signing from Telegram.
9. **Payback Scheduler** — `src/executor/payback/scheduler.mjs` — cron-driven (default weekly). On tick: computes `plannedPaybackBtc` from the BTC Accumulator snapshot and `src/config/payback.mjs` policy, then emits a payback intent for Policy Engine validation. The intent is a composite: destination-chain profit-reserve → wrapped BTC swap (CoW/Uniswap v3) → LayerZero Composer to BOB L2 → Gateway `OfframpRegistry.createOrder()` → Bitcoin L1 destination address. No keys; intent only.
10. **BTC Accumulator** — `src/executor/payback/accumulator.mjs` — pure function over the audit log + receipt store. Maintains a BTC-denominated rolling ledger: (a) harvest-period realized profit in BTC units, (b) lifetime paid-back BTC, (c) pending deferred payback, (d) per-KPI series for `BYR`, `CG`, `TBR`, `roundTripEfficiency`, `daysToBreakeven`. Writes a dashboard JSON slice but never mutates the audit log.

**Multichain is the default.** Every chain has its own RPC config, nonce manager, signer sub-account (or chain-indexed child key), and cap sub-budget. Strategies declare the chain set they touch. The payback engine MUST succeed end-to-end on at least Base → BOB L2 → Bitcoin L1 before any other chain is used as an intermediate profit-reserve location.

**LLM permissions matrix** (applies to Claude, Copilot, Codex, and any future coding agent):

| May | May not |
|---|---|
| Write or edit strategy code under `src/strategy/` | Embed or log a private key, even briefly |
| Write or edit policy functions under `src/executor/policy/` | Call the signer with raw tx bytes bypassing policy |
| Write or edit payback scheduler/accumulator under `src/executor/payback/` | Decide payback ratio, timing, or trigger at runtime |
| Propose cap changes via a committed diff | Raise caps (strategy or payback) at runtime through any side channel |
| Read audit logs | Delete, rotate in place, or rewrite audit logs |
| Configure a new chain by editing config | Move funds outside the Capital Manager |
| Trigger a manual dev-mode run | Decide when to sign — that's policy code's call |

**Audit log** — every sign attempt (approved, rejected, errored) and every payback disbursement appends to `logs/signer-audit.jsonl` with timestamp, strategy id (or `payback:<periodId>`), chain, intent hash, policy verdict, and (on broadcast) tx hash + receipt. On payback completion, also records Gateway order id and destination Bitcoin txid as a three-way receipt. Append-only. Never deleted. Never rotated in place.

## Payback Model

This is the system's product shape; all other rules here either support it or constrain it.

**Definition.** On a fixed schedule (default weekly), the Payback Scheduler harvests a configured fraction of realized BTC-denominated profit from the previous period and sends it as native BTC to the operator's Bitcoin L1 address. The remainder (default 75–80%) compounds inside the destination-chain operating float.

**Accounting unit.** BTC, satoshis internally. Every PnL field, every cap, every KPI in the payback engine is sats-first. USD is a display-layer projection, derived from a pinned oracle (`src/config/oracles.mjs`, whitelisted providers only) at render time. A strategy whose harvest produces only stablecoins must convert to BTC for accounting purposes before the accumulator records it — the conversion route and the pre/post sats are both logged.

**Default policy (stored in `src/config/payback.mjs`, not in code literals).** `baseRatio=0.20`, `minPaybackBtc=0.0005`, `maxOfframpCostPctOfPayback=0.10`, `regimeMultipliers={bear:1.2, neutral:1.0, bull_peak:0.7}` (bear/bull determined by Mayer Multiple vs 200d MA from a pinned source), volatility adjustment `volMultiplier=min(1.0, 0.5 / realizedVol60d)`, rolling 30-day realized volatility >100% halves the ratio. Each value justified in `docs/research/payback-rationale.md` — changing any of them requires citing the new rationale in the PR.

**Deterministic payback formula** (pseudocode, actual implementation in `.mjs`):

```
plannedPayback_sats =
    max(0,
        floor(
            profit_sats_in_period
          × baseRatio
          × regimeMultiplier(now)
          × volMultiplier(now)
        )
      − estimatedOfframpCost_sats
    )

if plannedPayback_sats < minPaybackBtc_sats:
    carry to next period, do not emit intent
if estimatedOfframpCost_sats > plannedPayback_sats × maxOfframpCostPctOfPayback:
    defer, do not emit intent
if anyEmergencyPauseTrigger():
    halt scheduler, log reason, notify Alerter
```

**KPI surface (BTC-denominated).** Stored in the dashboard JSON slice produced by the accumulator:

| KPI | Definition | Target band |
|---|---|---|
| BYR (BTC Yield Ratio) | paid-back BTC over trailing 12 months ÷ operating-capital BTC at period start | 5–15% |
| CG (Compound Growth) | operating-capital BTC growth over trailing 12 months | 10–25% |
| TBR (Total BTC Return) | (paid-back BTC + end operating BTC) ÷ start operating BTC − 1 | 15–40% |
| Round-trip efficiency | (gross realized profit BTC − Gateway round-trip cost BTC) ÷ gross realized profit BTC | >90% |
| Days to breakeven | periods until paid-back BTC covers initial round-trip entry cost | <60d |

The accumulator writes these to the dashboard status slice; the dashboard may display them but must not compute them.

**Settlement proof.** A payback period is only "delivered" when the Receipt Ingestor sees a Bitcoin L1 balance delta on the destination address matching the Gateway order. Source-side tx alone does not count. This is the same objective delivery-proof rule used for cross-chain wrapped-BTC routes (see Operator Memory).

## Build / Validation Order

This is a lane-aware build order, not a runtime phase gate. Runtime execution is still controlled only by committed config, caps, policy checks, signer approval, kill-switch, and receipt evidence.

1. Native BTC transport and settlement proof: Gateway quote/onramp/offramp, destination delivery proof, and Base → BOB L2 → Bitcoin L1 payback path.
2. Strategy evidence: destination-chain yield, lending loops, wrapper-BTC spreads, stable loops, LP/reserve sleeves, and any new deterministic strategy candidate.
3. Shadow/replay harness for the selected primary lane. The selected lane may be a strategy lane even when route alpha is exhausted.
4. Testnet/fork/mechanical execution harness for the selected lane, with strategy-specific receipt and unwind evidence where relevant.
5. Tiny live canary only when committed strategy config declares caps and `autoExecute: true`, and policy validates the intent.
6. Live operation with per-strategy caps, per-strategy unwind paths, watchdog, and receipt ingestor.
7. Payback engine: Scheduler + Accumulator + policy config. Base → BOB L2 → Bitcoin L1 is the first required settlement path; other profit-reserve chains expand only after round-trip efficiency on Base exceeds 90% on at least 8 consecutive periods.

## Dashboard Context

- Before changing dashboard UI, read `docs/dashboard-context.md`.
- The dashboard is a mobile-first BTC -> BOB -> chains flow map, not a table-first operator page.
- The browser may only read `dashboard/public/dashboard-status.json`; do not publish raw JSONL data.
- Dashboard copy must stay user-facing and visual. Avoid internal schema, signer, executor, or strategy jargon.
- `liveTrading` reflects whether the daemon's policy gate currently passes. `ALLOWED` is a normal state, not an exceptional one. The dashboard still must not hold keys, sign, or decide whether to trade — it only reports the gate state.
- The dashboard surfaces payback state as (a) last settled payback BTC and date, (b) pending/accruing BTC for next period, (c) KPI values from the accumulator. It does NOT show the payback formula, ratios, or triggers — those live in config only.

## Reporting

- Every result must distinguish paper PnL, estimated PnL, and realized PnL.
- **Every report must display BTC-denominated PnL first and USD projection second.** A report that shows only USD is incomplete and must be extended before being cited in a strategy decision.
- Every route report must include sample count, quote success rate, latency, fees, and rejection reasons.
- Every payback period writes a disbursement record to the audit log containing: period id, harvest window bounds, gross profit BTC, applied ratio/multipliers, planned payback BTC, estimated round-trip cost BTC, realized round-trip cost BTC, Gateway order id, Bitcoin txid, settled balance delta.

## Operator Memory

- When the user asks about the current strategies, answer in simple Korean first and keep the first explanation short.
- When freshness matters, prefer `npm run report:strategy-catalog -- --json` before giving the strategy snapshot.
- Latest known strategy snapshot:
  - BTC Gateway loops: `measured_below_policy` / transport infrastructure lane. Current route alpha has no confirmed positive edge.
  - BTC proxy spreads: `measured_below_policy` with thin/noisy coverage; keep as reevaluation lane, not primary alpha.
  - BTC stable entry/exit loops: `measured_below_policy`
  - BTC triangular/flash: `measured_below_policy`
  - Direct ETH-family Gateway: `thin_coverage`
  - ETH/stable mixed loops: `thin_coverage`
  - ETH mixed triangle: `analysis_only`
  - ETH mixed flash: `analysis_only`
  - Lending-protocol looping: `operator_hold` for wrapped-BTC lending-loop variants. Repo auto-build support and some receipts exist, but the operator's current judgment is that economics are not good enough for further promotion.
  - Wrapped BTC lending loop: `operator_hold` / not a primary lane. Limit work to unwind safety, evidence archiving, or explicit operator-directed reactivation.
  - ETH destination deployment: `design_scaffold` / allowed research and implementation target when fee domain, unwind cost, and BTC return path are measured.
  - Gateway native asset conversion sleeve: `design_scaffold` / intended for ETH, stable, gold, reserve, and other approved asset-family deployment with BTC payback compatibility.
  - **Payback engine: `scaffolded_active_carry`** — scheduler/accumulator/config exist and are reporting BTC-denominated pending carry. Current blocker is `planned_payback_below_minimum`, not missing payback code.
- If the user asks why ETH was "not validated", clarify that ETH was investigated and measured; the current outcome is "no confirmed edge," not "skipped work."
- Use this ETH explanation:
  - no measured multichain ETH-family Gateway surface yet
  - no measured mixed ETH/stable closed loop yet
  - ETH mixed triangle and flash paths are still analysis-only because the contract path is not generalized
  - therefore ETH lanes stay evidence-gated until a measured edge appears; they are not blanket observe-only, but they still need positive-EV and unwind evidence before promotion
- W4–W7 status (2026-04-22):
  - W4: 9 strategy adapters in `run-strategy-tick.mjs` registry: beefy-folding-vault, pendle-pt-lbtc-base, aerodrome-cl-base, pendle-pt-solvbtc-bbn-bsc, berachain-bend-bex-bgt, gmx-v2-perp-basis-avax, stablecoin-spread-loop, proxy-spread-expansion, tokenized-reserve-sleeve.
  - W5: `destination-venues.mjs` + `stable-venues.mjs` registries wired into `allocator-core.mjs` as protocol fallback.
  - W6: optimism/sei registered as `template_only` in venue registries with explicit blockers. Gateway API currently returns only 3 routes (bitcoin↔bob); quote fetch fails for optimism/sei. No dedicated adapters until route coverage expands.
  - W7: `micro-canary-slice.mjs` + `strategy-stage-slice.mjs` feed into `dashboard/public/strategy-tick-status.json` (schema v2). Dashboard frontend renders tick mode, micro-canary status, blocker count, top blocker, projectedNetUsd per strategy in the DeFi tab.
  - Mindmap payback return path: added orange dashed curve from protocol chip back to Bitcoin L1 for `gateway-btc-offramp` type.
  - Known failures: `wrapped-btc-loop-live.test.mjs:152` is pre-existing (mock collateral-swap output insufficient for iteration 2 repay). Not caused by W4–W7 changes. Documented in `docs/known-failures-2026-04-22.md`.
  - v1-infra-drills fix: `per_tx_cap_exceeded` drill amount bumped to 2_000_000 after cap neutralization changed perTxUsd to 1_000_000.
- Latest Gateway funding-memory for the live signer:
  - Sonic `wBTC.OFT -> Base wBTC.OFT` and Avalanche `wBTC.OFT -> Base wBTC.OFT` were executed successfully through BOB Gateway and consolidated onto Base signer `0x96262bE63AA687563789225c2fE898c27a3b0AE4`.
  - Both routes initially reverted because signer fallback gas was too low; retries succeeded only after using chain RPC `estimateGas` plus buffer.
  - Post-consolidation Base balances were still `cbBTC=0`, `USDC=0`, `wBTC.OFT=0.00039244`, `ETH=0.005268731623361094`, so wrapped-loop live receipt collection remained blocked by insufficient collateral and missing unwind USDC inventory.
  - Native Avalanche `AVAX` and Sonic `S` were investigated for further consolidation, but the current repo-safe Odos path did not produce a deterministic native->`wBTC.OFT` route suitable for unattended live use.
  - Strategy catalog dispatch is now implemented and was executed once in strongest-safe-mode form: 8/8 catalog lanes ran successfully, with `liveEligible=0`, so the batch fell back to shadow/analysis/dry-run rather than forcing live.
  - Native BTC onramp execution is now wired as `quote -> create-order -> Gateway PSBT -> BTC signer -> register-tx`; current live preview for signer address `bc1qpkdqyrycv900kh97jctjn83e2ypc0xfmhv8546` stops at Gateway `INSUFFICIENT_CONFIRMED_FUNDS`, so the blocker is confirmed BTC inventory, not missing executor code.
  - Reusable EVM Gateway BTC-family consolidation is now implemented as `executor:gateway-btc-consolidation`: `quote -> estimateGas -> explicit gasLimit buffer -> signer intent`. Current Avalanche `wBTC.OFT -> Base wBTC.OFT` preview reaches live quote successfully and then blocks at gas preflight with `execution_reverted`, which is the correct real-world signal when the source wallet no longer has a valid executable transfer path.
  - Objective delivery-proof rule: source-chain receipt alone is not enough to call a Gateway funding route fully successful. End-to-end success now requires destination-side proof such as wallet balance delta or destination receive evidence.
  - First end-to-end minimal live proof now exists: Base `wBTC.OFT -> BOB wBTC.OFT` for `1000` sats executed successfully with source tx `0x47357ec6143433a97414a2d4d923d6fbe3204338fd8b61fcc6923d8fa00ddcc9` and destination proof `erc20_balance_delta` on BOB (`initialBalance=0`, `settledBalance=1000`, `observedDelta=1000`, `requiredDelta=1000`).
  - Native-asset DEX live proofs now exist on Base / Avalanche / Sonic using `native -> wrapped native -> USDC` via Odos. Full tx set preserved in prior audit log entries.
  - Bob outbound and extended native-BTC settlement proofs now exist across Base/Avalanche/Sonic for `wBTC.OFT -> native BTC` and Base/Bera/Soneium/Unichain for `wBTC.OFT -> wBTC.OFT` destination-chain delivery. (Full tx list retained in prior audit log entries.)
  - Native BTC off-ramp is now proven live from Base, Avalanche, and Sonic through `executor:gateway-btc-offramp`. **This is the prerequisite the payback engine consumes — the Base → BOB → BTC L1 path is end-to-end live-proven as of this document's timestamp.**
  - Extra Gateway expansion chains (`bera`, `bsc`, `soneium`, `unichain`) have preview-ready Base `wBTC.OFT` funding routes; treasury/refill planning now emits explicit gas bootstrap jobs instead of silently stopping.
  - Strategy execution surfaces now report `missingExecutorCount = 0` for stablecoin entry/exit loops and mixed ETH/stable loops; these lanes run through dedicated analysis probes (`report:lane-reclassification`, `report:secondary-strategy-scaffolds`, `analyze:ethereum-routes`) and are no longer blocked by "no runner at all", though still not live-ready.
  - Merkl portfolio live-capital validation is active and multi-position: Base YO is filled to about `75` USD, Ethereum Aave Horizon RLUSD is open at `25` USD, Ethereum Morpho Clearstar USDC Core V2 is open at `75` USD, and Ethereum Morpho Steakhouse Prime Instant V2 is open at `50` USD. Live funding/refill receipts exist for BSC USDT -> Base USDC and BSC USDT -> Ethereum USDC/USDT/RLUSD through LI.FI. Additional deployment is blocked by refill inventory, Ethereum gas, unsupported protocol bindings, or chain/per-day caps, not by lack of Merkl candidates.
  - **Protocol Binding Registry (2026-04-24):** `src/executor/protocol-binding-registry.mjs` now centralizes all protocol dispatch. `merkl-portfolio-allocator.mjs`, `merkl-portfolio-exit.mjs`, and `merkl-canary-autopilot.mjs` all query the registry instead of hard-coded `Set` checks and `if/else` dispatch. Adding a new ERC4626-compatible protocol requires zero code changes elsewhere — call `registerErc4626LikeBinding("new_protocol_deposit_withdraw")` and it auto-wires plan builder, executor, and exit handler. Custom interfaces (non-ERC4626) still need a new helper module + manual registry entry.
  - **Merkl Portfolio Orchestrator (2026-04-24):** `npm run executor:merkl-portfolio-orchestrator` runs a single tick: Phase 1 exit stale positions, Phase 2 refresh treasury inventory, Phase 3 allocate freed capital into the highest-scoring opportunity. Loop mode available via `:loop` script. This replaces the separate exit-then-manually-wait-then-allocator workflow.

## Protocol Binding Registry

Detailed Merkl binding and orchestrator instructions live in `docs/merkl-protocol-bindings.md`. Keep this section as a pointer so `AGENTS.md` stays focused on operating rules and current memory.

## graphify

지식 그래프: `src/graphify-out/` (앱 코드, 기본) + `graphify-out/` (레포 전체, 보조).
post-commit / post-checkout git 훅이 자동으로 그래프를 갱신한다. 수동 `graphify update`는 훅 실패 시에만.

### 사용 판단 (토큰 절감 목적, 객관 트리거)

**graphify 먼저 쓸 것** — 벤치 3~10x 절감:
- 기본 진입은 `npm run graph:focus -- explain <심볼>` / `path <A> <B>` / `query <질문>` 으로 시작한다. 이 래퍼는 앱 그래프를 기본값으로 쓰고 `query` budget을 낮게 잡아 출력 과다를 줄인다.
- "X가 무엇에 연결?"·"이 함수의 호출자"·"이 모듈의 이웃" → `python3 -m graphify query "질문" --graph src/graphify-out/graph.json`
- 단일 심볼 관계 설명 → `python3 -m graphify explain "심볼명" --graph src/graphify-out/graph.json`
- 두 개념 간 경로 추적 → `python3 -m graphify path "A" "B" --graph src/graphify-out/graph.json`
- 아키텍처 전반 훑기 → `src/graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- 루트 스크립트·vendored 코드 → `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- **3개 이상 파일 읽을 것 같으면 먼저 `graphify query`로 관련 노드만 추려 읽을 파일 수를 줄인다**

**graphify 쓰지 말 것** — 요약으로 정확성 손실:
- 정확 수치·인용·버전 문자열 추출
- `docs/research/*` 및 .md 문서 질문 (그래프는 .mjs/.js AST만, 문서 노드 없음)
- 버그 원인·로직 분석·주석 의도 파악
- 수정 대상 파일은 반드시 원문 읽기

### 운영
- 기본 그래프: `src/graphify-out/graph.json` (연결성 99.5%). 루트 그래프는 테스트/vendored 섬 포함으로 92% — 보조용.
- 허브에 제네릭 이름(`slice()`, `sort()`, `main()`) 있음 → 질의 시 파일 경로 필터 권장.
- 훅 상태: `python3 -m graphify hook status`.

- 매 작업이 끝날 때마다 **항상 짧은 종료 요약**을 남긴다. 길게 늘어놓지 말고, 지금 어디까지 왔는지 먼저 보이게 쓴다.
- 종료 요약의 첫 줄은 반드시 `현재 단계: L0/L1/L2/...` 형식으로 쓴다.
- 그 다음에는 아래 3가지를 쉬운 말로 짧게 정리한다:
  - `이번에 한 일`: 실제로 바뀐 것만 1~3문장
  - `왜 아직 그 단계인지`: blocker를 사실 기반으로 짧게
  - `다음 체크리스트`: 바로 이어서 할 수 있는 작업을 체크리스트로
- `다음 체크리스트`는 가능하면 3개 이하로 유지하고, 각 항목은 실행 단위로 쪼갠다.
- 사용자가 이해하기 쉽게 쓰는 것이 우선이다. 내부 모듈명은 꼭 필요할 때만 쓰고, 쓰면 한 줄로 의미를 풀어쓴다.
- 단계가 안 올라갔으면 숨기지 말고 그대로 말한다. 대신 “무엇이 정리됐는지”를 짧게 같이 적는다.
- 추정이나 희망 섞인 표현 대신, 방금 확인한 파일/로그/명령 결과를 기준으로만 설명한다.

## Workspace Hygiene

- `data/`, `docs/current-status.md`, `dashboard/public/dashboard-status.json` 같은 상태 산출물은 실행 때마다 다시 생성되므로 기본적으로 로컬 운영 artifact로 취급한다.
- 자동 실행 후 워크트리가 다시 더러워졌다면, 먼저 "생성 산출물"인지 "실제 코드 변경"인지 구분해서 설명한다.
- 생성 산출물은 가능하면 git 추적 대상에 다시 섞지 않는다. 코드 변경과 운영 산출물을 한 커밋에 섞지 않는다.
- 코드 변경이 `의미 있는 실행 단위`까지 쌓였으면 사용자 지시를 기다리지 말고 **알아서 커밋**한다. 기준은 예를 들어 새 CLI 1개 + 테스트, 운영 규칙 1묶음 + 회귀 테스트, 또는 동일한 목적의 파일 변경이 3개 이상일 때다.
- 자동 커밋 전에는 반드시 관련 테스트/검증을 먼저 돌리고, 커밋 후에는 `현재 단계`, `이번에 한 일`, `왜 아직 그 단계인지`, `다음 체크리스트` 형식으로 짧게 보고한다.
- 자동 커밋은 `작은 기능 단위`로 자주 한다. unrelated 변경이 섞여 있으면 나눠 커밋하고, push는 사용자가 막지 않는 한 같은 흐름에서 이어서 진행한다.
